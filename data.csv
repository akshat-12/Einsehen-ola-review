                I cannot begin to explain my disappointment and frustration with OLA. I have multiple times tried to book a ride that seem to be cheapish then for it to take at least 5mins for someone to accept. Most of the times I lose patience and click cancel ride then I still get charged $10-$17 without even getting a ride. Ola is terrible and a scam. NEVER USE OLA

                Ola advertise 5km for $5.00 what a ripoff from my house to the air port is 4.7 km. The Ola driver arrivedat my house the proceeded to take a long route(a route I have neve used). this route then proved to be in excess of 7km for which I was charged My wfe and i questioned the driver as to where he was going but we were ignored. To top it all the driver was driving at about 80 km/hr in a 50 zone. The nett result is, I  will not use Ola again and bad mouth them at any opportunity I get. I emailed Ola about a week ago to voice my concerns, they have yet to show me the courtesy of a reply. A RIPOFF

                The driver first called me asking me to walk from the pickup point to meet him where he was. when i refused as I had several bags with me he did come. He then started following the gps suggested route as agreed.We were on the highway and ant the very last second he veered off the road onto the offramp. I then checked with him if he was all right, making such an abrupt move at 100kmh took me by complete surprise! he said yes and that the gps seemed to change at the last second. I suggested we return to the highway and he agreed but instead of doing so continued to drive away from the highway into the back streets, slowly zigzagging his way towards my house. at this point he was completely ignoring the gps.Once we got back to a major road approaching a traffic light the light changed to yellow, we were very close and could have comfortably made it though. instead he chose to brake abruptly sending my possessions onto the floor and prompting the car behind us to beep in frustration.After getting home my fair was sent to me and was 31% higher than quoted! I tried to follow this up with Ola but I cant find any way of actually getting in contact with someone. Only a support system telling me thanks for your feedback, the case is now closed.

                Well, after several times using Ola without a problem I suddenly had one of the issues that a lot of other people here have been complaining about.  In my case the fare at the end of the ride was suddenly 2.5 times the estimate that had been provided and double the most expensive I have ever paid for a trip that I do regularly.  No explanation.  The trip took no longer than normal.The worst thing is that Ola deliberately make it almost impossible to make contact with them.  And by the way, if your ride was 2 days old or more - there is no ability to get it put right.  And by the way - the email address listed for Ola below?  Don't bother with it - it doesn't exist.Ola will be one app that is coming off my phone.

Also I asked to Police for help !!I request you to avoid such kind of mental people from your company and hire people who know how to treat with their customer.

","
                First of all, I was charged exponentially big amount than I supposed to be paying. Delhi airport to Ajmer where my house is 387KM but the OLA magically increased it to 487KM, and charged me INR 11009 which is a lot because I travel from ajmer to Delhi airport IT CAN NEVER BE 487, so OLA APP is Deformed and they are making fool out of people.Then the driver had CNG ISSUES in his car he took me two different gas stations where he couldn’t find the CNG but we waited 40 minutes just at gas station(CNG). He said you will get your money back in your OLA ACCOUNT.The cab itself was a flop show the OLA APP gave false promises that your cab will be with luxury features I could hardly sit in there my luggage was on the backseat and it’s a CNG CAR SO NO POINT I CAN KEEP MY LUGGAGE IN THE DIGGI.OlA SHOLD NOT FORCE TRAVELLER TO HAVE SIT IN THE CNG CARS IF ITS OUTSTATION AND CHARGING STUPID FEES.the meter at the beginning of the trip showed meter reading    :       214661kmTrip end reading:       215048KM If you do math it’s :  387kmBUT OLA math said it’s 487KM they added 100km extra from somewhere no one knows.I was charged for extra time. First of all the driver ran out of CNG and made we wait 40 minutes each time every time he took me to different different CNG stations.It was the most pathetic experience I have ever had in traveling with OLA.Since the beginning the driver had no clue what he was doing.The cab stunk like tobacco as the driver was kept eating and the whole messed up. The car dint have AC and the driver kept the windows open till the whole trip. I asked him to turn it down but he dint turn the AC on.I just want to know why that happened. For sure this was my last and final trip with OLA ever and I will spread the word so no one should travel with OLA.I want to be called by OLA and solve this issue. Give me my money back.

                Cheap and cheerful is far from the truth! Ola is possibly worse than Uber! I booked a car for a 0.99 mile journey (3mins drive from where I was) at £3-£4 which confirmed my driver was 3mins away, waited 4-5mins still no car. Went back onto the app but the car was no longer there, I didn’t want to book again as I didn’t want to be charged for 2 bookings. I used my other phone which showed the price for an Ola was £3-£4 for the same journey. While in the process of booking the price suddenly jumped up to £7-£12!!! How disgusting! I had no choice as it was pouring with rain and I’m also pregnant! I explained to the driver who was also appalled by the price! I then checked again on my other phone to see that my original driver cancelled and the price had gone down back to £3-£4! The customer service is terrible as you can’t actually communicate with anyone... You get a generic computer response as to why you've been charged that price. The hygiene of the drivers is unprofessional, the cars are always filthy and a lot of them drive like they haven’t even had a driving test.

Explained the situation further and told them he never got to my location and this is an absolute lie! I get cabs every day and I’m always wearing a mask. They were absolutely useless and claimed “the system does not allow” them to process a refund! Very very frustrating. Spoke to about 5 different people including managers and they all repeated the same thing like robots. Ended up getting robbed of my money and wasted a whole lot of time and energy, never using this trash service again! They reduce their customers to 0 and are absolute thieves.

                        Extremely poor customer service
                
","
                If I could give this company zero stars I would. Avoid this company at all costs. I booked a journey but the driver cancelled the ride. I then booked a second driver, was collected and dropped off at my destination. I then realised that I had been charged for the cancelled journey. I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn't take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience. How is this company even in business? Again avoid this company at all costs.

                The worst customer service I have ever received. I was dropped off at the incorrect location and charged for the trip. It is not possible to lodge this sort of complaint via the app and I needed to send an email. I was told I was charged the correct fare. When I disputed this email, I received the same copy and paste response as their last email. No refund or further investigation or explanation. Uber on the other hand would have refunded the trip immediately. Would never use this company again and I strongly recommend that you don't either!

","
                Ola have tried to take me for a fool. I do not recommend this app at all, the customer 'care' team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!this saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road.  Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.I waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)I messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place. The driver messaged back saying he can't pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense. Instead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for 'violating covid-regulations'. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn't take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!I phoned the 'customer care' line which was a complete waste of time. The 'advisor' refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was 'breaking covid violations'. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the 'advisor' talked about how the 'system won't allow a refund' which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!I then emailed this complaint to their 'customer care' team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their 'evidence' of their made up false accusation of me not 'following covid regulations' and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point. Predictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint. I was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home. I can't take public transport due to the health risks and travel bans, and OLA has no sense of service or moral compass.

Driver didn't even know where he was going and driving off after first drop was Completely uncalled for after making my brother late and me late. Worse experience ever. On top of this I lost hours at work. Will demand explanation for this.

I gave the right location but the driver dropped me off at a completely different location. I tried calling customer care almost 10 times but I couldn’t get connected. I even raised a Security concern from the Ola app during the ride but I got a call back from the Security desk almost 1 hour after my trip ended. After the driver dropped me at a totally different location I had to pay him ₹250 and then had to take another cab to reach my destination. Later when I finally got connected to the customer care agent she said they can’t do anything if the driver dropped you at the wrong location it is Google Map’s fault not theirs. I said I want a full refund because this is their App’s issue but she said we can’t give you anything and started shouting and arguing with me. I am never booking an Ola again and would advise everyone to do the same.

                I had a ride taken which was out of station from Hyd-Wgl. In the midway of the trip i made a payment on the app(Rs 2500) and my price is changed once i got down(Rs 3500 extra 1000) which was explained due to the tolls and all. Once the driver(Nelakanti Srikanth) dropped me off he asked me to pay the whole amount in cash not just the balance and he will cancel my earlier online payment and i will get the money back in 2 days as he needs money to refuel the petrol and go back to Hyd. I felt his point made sense and paid 3500Rs in cash to him its been 3 weeks and i havent received my money yet and whenever i create a ticket they say they spoke to the driver and he told he didnt take any additional cash. I am robbed off 2500 rupees and everyone is lying in here. Its so pathetic that the driver(nelakanti Srikanth) mentioned that he didnt take any extra money when he actually did. I am sure everything will be seen by God and he will be punished accordingly for cheating people. My suggestion to everyone is never take a Ride with Ola and even if you had to make sure your driver isnt Nelakanti Srikanth who is a cheat

                I'm not one for complaining but the driver today took the mick.In short, he decided to take the long and wrong route, which made my commute time longer and I got charged extra. He did say sorry but I was a bit upset about it.But the horrible part was just trying to get in touch with customer care.If I went to support on the app and clicked on payment discrepancy options, it would show me why I got charged that much and thats it. It gave me no option to escalate it.I then tried escalating my complaint on the website but there was issues logging on the website. I then managed to find a way to contact them by googling it, which is through the 'I did not ge the offer discount' section on the app.All in all though. The customer experience was horrendous and I do not know how a company like this exists in UK, and they shouldn't deserve to operate if this is how they run things. Go uber.

Got charged a cancellation fee for 'not adhering to Covid 19 guidelines' which is weird, because on the app the driver drove around in a circle for 5 mins, never actually arrived at our pickup point and then cancelled the ride. So I am perplexed as to how he could have come to that conclusion when we never actually saw him! Back and forth with customer care and they're refusing to refund the cancellation fee.So after being inconvenienced by a waste of time driver, who has found a way around being liable for cancelling journeys, somehow I have to pay a fee?! Sticking to Uber from now on.

Uber might look expensive but at least their pricing is very transparent and there are no hidden charges that gets charged after you have completed your ride. I had to pay 32$ for a ride that was estimated to be max 17$. After inquiring with support  I was told the original price was estimated to be 28-35$ which was not true. I would have never booked it if it was that high. PLEASE don't use it. Use Uber instead you will be better off with uber. I am from New Zealand so this review is for NZ customer. I have uninstalled the app now don't want to ever use this company. No negative star so giving them 1 star. Bloody Crooks.Also, NZ customer if you have also faced the  price hike please raise this issue with the Commerce Commission so that this company gets reviewed. It is not about money it is a about the principle of it.  I will be doing the same.

","
                So... I actually worked for OlaCabs in the UK in the past - and what a shocking company to work for... Let's get some technical nitty-gritty stuff out of the way first:1) logging in to the olacabs website as a driver, and I'm REQUIRED to tick the box aggreeing to my number or data being used, so that I can be sent further materials or promotions or news in the future2) there's no way to use the Ola Driver / Ola Partner app with Developer Mode enabled on your device. I had hoped that this was going to be addressed, but 18 months later and it's still forced on people to disabled developer mode. 3) once you login online, there's no way to get a printout of all your completed fares, or a yearly summary for tax purposes.Okay - so now down to dealing with the company itself... If you've ever got a query or concerned about anything, contacting OlaCabs is pretty much useless. Their support have poor language skills, so a lot of the time don't even understand what's being asked of them. Both as a user and driver, I've had to contact OlaCabs Support several times just to get one singular issue resolved.When I first started working for them, they were renting office space, and trying to find which office was a nightmare, because there was nobody around from OlaCabs at the office - they were all in some waiting area with no signage to communicate that. Then I had an issue receiving my sign-up bonus, being told that the ""offer had expired"" essentially even though it couldn't have, as the dates depicted on their own advertisement cards to get more drivers had me doing everything correct, to the correct timescale. When things are working properly in the driver app, it seems to be fine and apart from what I can only deem as ""random cancellations"" (because I've seen the same customer at the same location attempting to request a taxi later on) I've not had many issues from that sort of perspective. But the DRIVER app needs an overhaul and development from a team that actually want to be part of this universal ""competition"" for being a company that provides taxi services to the public. Their USER app - for requesting rides - seems to be okay for the most part as it's been updated to be similar in end user experience to what Uber offer, but the Uber platform and everything about it is just so much better. My honest opinion? Pay a slightly higher price that features a bit more safety, and get an Uber. . . . As a final note, I would like to say that I've seen people give low ratings because ""the driver took the long way round"". There isn't an excuse for doing that deliberately, but most of the time drivers are following their GPS or taking longer routes that avoid congestion and traffic jams. Of course, people seem to have forgotten how to communicate, because passengers can always tell or show the driver(s) a better route. I guess the art of communication is lost these days. A lot of the time, people just want to get to where they're going - they don't want it to take excessive amounts of time or be extortionate, financially - but to make the complaint ""they went the long way"" when you don't say anything yourself is almost ironic.

If I hadn't had my banking app on my phone I would not have known!Called the support to be told""sorry"" and made a slight reduction on the original fare cost.I made it clear ""sorry"" doesn't cut it when you place your card on an app and the company accesses your account with Fraudulent rides. Asked who regulates them and told No one.. Shocking.. I wonder how many other accounts they've raided!!Then, to make it worse they removed the Fraudulent ride appearing on my app info in rides..

Complained to Ola and they just said ""sorry"" but refused to refund money - even though it showed on their GPS he had done this. 2 days later booked a cab which I was told would be $7-9 and they charged me $42.50!

                I am completely dissatisfied with the Ola service I have received. Your reviews on Google are a clear reflection of how you value customers as a series of 1 star reviews seem to be the normal rating for your services.I have a number of issues.I spoke to UJAN on the phone to complain about the unjustifiable jump in price CHARGED in comparison to the quote. Original charge quoted £6-9 which is what I booked at...and charged the day before at only £5 for the exact same journey...Then I get a message on completion of the journey of £18!That is a 3x price hike with no reasonable justification.Ujans reasoning on the phone was that there was not enough taxi cabs in the area. I saw at least 6 taxi cabs within a 200 metre radius and I booked it at a destination on a main road, where I even walked closer to the meeting point to make the pickup easier and drive literally on a straight road for no more than ten minutes. High demand of taxis cannot be a reason To charge 3x the price when there was multiple cars sitting and waiting on the roads for passengers, and especially as I know my area and where the taxi drivers sit and wait around, there was no inconvenience to any driver and no shortage of cars. A few weeks previous I had a series of issues with your driver's cancelling rides unannounced whilst in Birmingham trying to get to a work meeting. I was LATE to that meeting by over 30 minutes solely due to cancelled rides because of your driver's and lack of communication. Thankfully that was resolved and I was refunded a cancellation charge that your driver's seem to have a habit of doing outside of London, with no consequence. But the inconvenience that this app has given me each time I have decide to give it a chance is unacceptable.I have never been charged outside of the threshold with Uber or Kapten. Only Ola.I have also never had to deal with such consistent poor service in regards to misrepresentation of service.It is almost disrespectful that Ola seems to have a complete disregard to clients needs and concerns. Ujan was not helpful at all and to be honest had a tone that no client would be satisfied with having been charged a disproportionate amount.I will be complaining further to parties who can make sure your directors are aware of the misrepresentation and negligence of your staff and scam worthy technology. If this means going to press and community leaders who will investigate your operations further, then so be it. I have never used Uber and been charged an amount they make up out of the top of their head. So I refuse to use a new app like Ola and have you steal money from more clients and will make sure I share the message to others to avoid this all at all costs. I would never pay £18 for a journey I could take for £1.50 on a bus, £2.90 on a train or £5-6 using any taxi service. So for your company to deem it acceptable to not notify an individual and charge them an inflated price is quite frankly unethical and unprofessional. I demand a refund of £13 for the journey. I am extremely dissatisfied.

No comparison between world class company like Uber and a highly unprofessional Ola. I had taken a ola cab from Delhi to jaipur. Initially it showed me 2700 fare and driver knew i came from abroad. He stopped the cab on the way 4 times for almost 2 hrs adding all together. He took 500 rupees for gas too. When i reached jaipur he requested 950 rupees for toll plaza so overall he took 5200 rupees despite having showing 2900 bill initially. Being a NRI i didn't know much about long rides using ola but definitely it was a very poor experience.i complained about it to ola just and email because there is no phone number showing on the website. Ola replied back after 4 days sating thry can't do anything and closed the ticket immediately with notifying me. Highly unprofessional and never replied back to my queries again. Safety concerns were also there but ola doesn't reply at all. Please boycott ola and avoid them. I am going to post this experience everywhere including UK ola services too because i have no choice left because of their lack of response. I will take legal action as well against them.

Ola customer service is extremely useless and don’t care about their customers and deem it okay for drivers to drive without a face mask in the middle of a global pandemic. Avoid at all cost.

                        OLA AND UBER CABS IN BENGALURU
                
","
                OLA AND UBER CABS IN BENGALURUIt appears to me that the most dangerous Ola and Uber Cab service is in Bengaluru, as I always thought Delhi was bad, but Bengaluru beats it heads on.The drivers appear to have learnt to manipulate so many tricks to fleece the customers, that I have come to the conclusion it may not only be better, but also safer at times to pay double and book the hotel taxi if at all possible.On a recent 5 days visit to Bengaluru, on at least 6 different occasions, the drivers made numerous attempts to cheat me, firstly from the Airport to the Hotel, when I gave the OTP to commence the journey, within seconds of obtaining a message that the trip has commenced, the driver tells me that there is no trip and wanted  to see my phone, basically to see what the fare was showing. I remained very firm, and informed my wife that in case the situation worsened, and he took us out of the way, to immediately call the police, because there is absolutely no facility on their apps to reach Customer Service or Police in an emergency. The driver then gathered that I was going to have none of his nonsense, and I turned on the navigation on my mobile phone and ensured he took us to the hotel in the shortest route possible.  This actually happened with at least two drivers, but the worst ones were that once you book the cab, the driver calls to ascertain what the final destination is, which they are not supposed to, and immediately cancels the trip thereby incurring the passenger a cancellation charge.The worst one was on having booked in advance for an airport drop off, the first driver asked my destination and as I refused to give it, cancelled the booking, and within seconds another driver accepted the booking. When I informed him that the drop was to the airport, he tells me that he is not going, when I said I will complain about him, he became abusive and threatened me, saying he knew where I was and would come and sort me out. As I was getting late for the airport, I fortunately managed to book the Hotel Taxi and reached the airport just in time.The government has brought in new regulations in respect to all the aggregator cab services, which are more in favour of the drivers. I am in favour of that, but it is absolutely imperative that new legislation is made in regards to the safety of passengers and unwarranted cancellations, because despite writing to the CEO of OLA, he neither had the courtesy to acknowledge nor respond to my mail, and it is about time they were held responsible for all the illegal actions of the drivers or ensure that these crooked drivers do not ply cabs on their platforms immediately after they resort to threats or regular cancellations of the cab journeys.

                Dear Ola Team, I start my journey from govandi station to vashi sector 9 it's hardly 11/ 12 km while booking amount was Rs 148 as per me its ok for 11 km .But the driver had changed the route and while asking him he said google yehi route bata raha hai.I had confirmed auto driver ki ye aap gumake k le rahe ho so he confirmed me aap daro mat aapko kitna charge bataya hai utna hi lunga mai and after giving the amount Rs.148 he is saying sirji 344 hua hai.and start arguing ki paisa toh aapko dena hoga aapko nhi pata kya mera auto kalyan ki hai aapko bolna chaiye tha na.Its was very worst journey if my life.its waste of money & time. driver had taken the wrong route instead of 11 km he taken the route of 27 km and the charges also claimed.They was not enough time for fighting with auto driver.because from Morning me and my wife was out for some bank work my daughter was in my neighbor house so we have to rush as early as possible so that we can give her some food it was almost 2:30 at afternoon.so I paid the amount 350 and I will make sure from today my family or from my office no one will use ola.

If you need a reliable service and you do not want wait for over 10-15 minutes for the driver to arrive, I suggest you look elsewhere!

                Hi Ola,            It's a very bad experience riding in ola. Auto driver came and said my mobile is switched off. Hence, what ever amount is showing the total amount in your ola application please pay that amount. In my application Rs.251 was showing and I paid Rs.251. after driver went away ola application showing  your total fare is 186rs. I paid rs.65 rupees. Hence, I have got cheated by ola auto driver. I think this is the trick which is using by ola drivers to make customer fool by telling mobile is switched and taking away extra cash. Even I told ola auto driver that shall I pay online wallet payment when I was I auto on the way but driver refused and said no no don't do online or wallet payment. Only cash I need he said. Ola drivers are very greedy they only operates and come when the ride is by cash only. This is not not the concern or 65rs. It's about trust. I have been cheated from ola hence, I will not use or use less ola. I might switch to Uber or can prefer local auto or rides but this type of cheating is not acceptable. I can knock the consumer court and complain in consumer court for this issue.Thank youName : Shyam RanjanPhone : 7004835713

                If I could give this company zero points I would as I’m disgusted by them. It was my first experience of using an cab app as have heard positive things about cab apps. I booked one from Shepherd’s Bush to Euston tower. I had no problems as it reached me within a few minutes. But was another story going back to Shepherd’s Bush. Booked one and it said seven minutes then said 27 minutes as it was no dropping off another customer. I sent the driver a message to say where I’d be and with two very heavy suitcases. He drives past me and my ride is cancelled. Apparently he couldn’t stop the car! Then I ring the ‘customer service’ line and explain but to no avail. I explained that it was imperative that I got home quickly as I had to collect my son from school. Security staff tried to contact local cabs and tried to flag down a black cab but to no avail. Then I reluctantly had to order another Ola cab. Again it gave a time then kept chopping and changing because he picked someone else on the way. Fortunately there was a black cab nearby charging and I was able to get a cab back. Honestly I will never recommend this company to anyone especially single women on their own and in fact anyone who hasn’t hours to waste and values their safety. They have zero duty care for customers. Profit before customer care! Avoid Ola at all costs. Stick to black cabs 🙏🏽

They are thieves and there is no reprimand policy in place for when their drivers lie and a fraudulent .The name of my driver was ehsan abbashabi driving a silver Toyota Prius. No one use him.

                I booked for a cab to go for a hospital. When I boarded the cab after giving the password, the driver said to pay Rs. 84 for a ride which did not even started. When I enquired with the driver, he said this has happened many times and spoke to customer support. When there was no proper reply from customer support, I did not use the service. This kind of nuisance happens a lot with ola, and I would never use this service nor recommend to anyone.

Ive got the details of the car and reg number as well. I waited her at a clear well visible place standing on the kerb. App showed her very accurate and finally she just passed me without slowing down (It was exatcly that car with that make/model and reg) and in the next second app says ""it was cancelled"" No reason explained, no option given to find someone else, nothing. This is a joke, not a service. I wasted 15 minutes from my life. Ive ordered an Uber after this, without any problem.

                Horrible service from OlaI booked Ola from the airport to my home and it was literally a nightmare. During the ride I paid the money from my Phone pay app and transaction got successful, however the amount got deducted from my account but in Ola app it’s not uploaded so the driver on completion of ride saying that he had not received any payment, so I tried one more time for online payment and same situation happens again. So at the end I have paid him by cash. So two times in online payment my money got deducted.After reaching my home I have raised the complaint to phone pay and Ola to return back my two times failed transaction money, so from phone pe I got reply that Ola is saying that they provide service for both the transaction so transaction is valid which is totally a lie from Ola side and after providing all the transaction related proof to Ola, They took more than one month to decide that my complaint is valid and they have to refund me money of online transactions because I did not use any service regarding that transactions.Now when they are agree that I have made the payment thrice that day, they are refunding my money back to my Ola account only so I can used in future booking from Ola app, which is not acceptable they should refund my money back to my bank account from where I made transaction. In response of my query they are saying that they cannot refund back my money in my bank account because it is against their policy. I oppose this type of customer unfriendly policy and also want people support in destroying this type of policy by boycotting the Ola app.So disappointed with Ola overall and will not be using in future.Be Aware before using Ola app.

                To say I am fuming is an understatement and when the banks won't refund the money and OLA won't refund the money it feels utterly useless!My ride was meant to be £31 and I ended up being charged £72!! The driver lied and said a road was closed and therefore took me another route with added 15 minutes onto my journey plus this added surcharge that was never shown when I ordered it!!! The bank won't refund without proof of the price but how can you get proof when you click to accept a ride and its gone??? As for the driver I know there will be no action and I will just be deleting my account

                Just got off the phone with a customer service representative from this company and I’m more and more convinced of how little they care about their clients. Shortly, my ride went like so: get in the car ask how long it should take. Waze (shows live traffic and road closures) advises 25 minutes. It took over 45 minutes. The driver took a longer, busier route on purpose. When he realised he got himself into a massive traffic jam he just told me I should get out cause we’d never actually get to the drop off point. Had to walk over 10 minutes to reach this. Completely out of order. I informed the customer service department and after three calls where the people on the other end kept repeating the same things like a broken disc. All this made me understand that even though they know and confirm they didn’t provide the service they were meant to they couldn’t care less. They just want your money, if you have a terrible experience with them whatever. They already took the cash out of your account.

This is a complete scam and I was outrageously charged £6 which they are unable refund me (only give a voucher-assuming I want to use their app again after this??) I’ve had many more experiences of unprofessionalism from a handful of drivers on Ola- this is the last straw, will not be using again, not surprised their rating is so low.

","
                This is the first time I am using Ola that too because of COVID situation and it has been a very bad experience. I think where OLA should have been a little more sensitive during COVID situation they are in fact by taking long routes and over charging the customers for the same.Being a doctor my each minute is precious (and not only for me it is for each customer) but every time the ola people take a longer route to mint more money and at the same time I always reach my clinic late despite boarding the Ola Auto on time. I have been travelling since 6 Jul 2020 and mostly i get a fare of around 162/- sometimes it is 174 or 182/- and little bit difference in amount is understandable but on many rides they calculate the fare around 240 and that much difference is not acceptable. When their driver cancels the ride then also they charge it from the customer, even after complaining they don't refund the amount. They deliberately take long routes to overcharge the customers and now last time when i refused to pay 240 and paid my regular fare so now they have been asking me to pay 81 rs to resume the services. Instead of unethically extracting money from customers OLA should make sure that their services are up to the mark. So my advise to OLA1. Value your passenger/customer's time2. Value their money3. Make sure you take correct routes so that your customers are not overcharged and also they reach their destination on time.4. Don't unnecessarily harass your customers and your drivers (i have seen your drivers too frustrated with your management)5. Whereas you claim that you are following all precautionary guidelines for COVID but I have seen only 20% of your OLA autos having a protective sheet between the driver and passenger, I have not seen any of your OLA driver sanitizing the seats, many drivers have to be repeatedly reminded of wearing their mask.Being a doctor I had thought by using your services it would be convenient for me to reach my clinic comfortably and on time. But I was highly disappointed. So stop harassing your customers and if you continue to send me messages to pay for the overcharged ride then I will have to move to the consumer court since i have screen shots of all the rides that I have taken with you so far. Anyhow I am sure of one thing I will never recommend OLA to anyone.Dr. Jaishree

Took cab for 1 pm reached hospital in 50 mins. He waited for 45 mins and Dr. Asked me to go for a scan which is 2 kms away. I'm having a 8 months old baby. I ask him he said I can't come to kilpauk. Better u close this cab and take another one. I'm saying it's just 2 kms away. Without any humanity he said take another one. Still 4 hrs didn't complete. His rude behavior I don't want to travel with him. Pls I'm having his name and number. Ola should take appropriate action on him

                I would give no stars if possible. Pretty sure this company is a scam. Tried to use them as they were new and had great new member deals. Service really is everything!Ordered a taxi and waited at the end of my road as I know there can be bad traffic. Taxi said 3mins. After he took 4 wrong turns from my route and was driving away from my address I cancelled and was change. Gave them a second go another day thinking that must be a one off bad driver. Again book a taxi, wait outside my front door, mask on. Taxi is at the bottom of my road, doesn’t turn down the road and cancels my journey because I’m not following covid protocols. Get charged. Then again have to use another service to make my journey and have to pay twice.I called immediately to customer services and he said sorry loads of drivers are doing that at the moment. Annoying I know but I’m not authorised to give you a refund. Clearly they are not set up to actually take journeys fully. A lot of marketing and terrible service. Wouldn’t use again and wouldn’t recommend. Would warn people way.

How disgusting of a human being. She didn’t pay him the $10 so he drove off with the wheel chair!!!! The next day she left the chair near our letter box and it was raining heavy that day and it got soaked. I will take this further and will name and shame him. Disgraceful he should get fired !!!!!!!

If you need any clarity we request you to please contact us on...”When I queried this I received an almost identical reply.

Please guys, don't message you have arrived in pick a point if you are still 1 to 5  minutes away, and then you charge waiting time. That is not good practice. We can see it in the app, how far you are and how many minutes more before you arrive. Most often than not I stand by the road waiting even before my ride arrives. So you can't trick me that you arrived early and charge a waiting fee.

                I lost my phone in the Ola Cab because I took out of my pocket to show Ola how I feel unsafe during in my ride because the driver speed was high and during in drive use he second phone! It was my mistake I did check my pocket when I left the car and I run behind the car and I try to stop the driver because my phone was left in the backseat! After 10-15- minutes later I call Support they said during in my call couldn't reach the driver! So I call after that nightmare every day Support and I asked them if they contact with the driver! After 3Days and 5phone call later they can have opportunity to talk with the driver! Regarding the poor quality Support I call the Support Team and I mentioned them they break the terms and conditions first Second They actually break the law because the Costumer Support give me wrong information about my concerns and because I recorded all those phone calls it's my right to take them to the court because actually they made a Crime in UK! I don't know how a long and what's the end about the story only what I know stay away for that Company!

                Wish they had introduced 0 rating as well. I was wrongly charged for a ride that I booked on June 27th for which I paid the driver via Gpay. I thought that was it. I tried booking another ride after a couple of days and the app asked me to pay outstanding amount of Rs 581 to book a new ride, which for obvious reasons I didn't pay. Since then I've been receiving continuous messages on my phone to pay the due. I tried reaching ola support for consecutively 2 days from the app which felt like a lifetime of struggle (I'm sure most of us will agree to it) and I got connected to an executive. I told her all that had happened, then I got to know that the driver had raised a complaint of not being paid. I was shell shocked and told her that I have all of the details along with the transaction receipt to which she said ok I've raised a complaint on behalf of you and the team will get in touch via mail (which never happened). I waited for a couple of days and wrote a mail to ola support for which I got the same revert that the team is working on the issue and get quick help by clicking ""support section"" in the ola app. Today, the 9th of July, I wrote them back and there's nothing from them again. I guess I've made my point and by the look of other user's experience, we all know what decision to be taken.

He said he can’t refund my money and then later putting me on hold again then goes the driver saying he couldn’t find you and that’s why he cancelled I was so furious at this point it’s like the guy on the phone seemed so unbothered and having a laugh about this.

                Please think twice and do not use this app especially when you're in an emergency. I have to say that yesterday was a disaster because of Ola. I had a midwife appointment at the UCLH in the early morning and tried to get a taxi from Ola three times. The first driver accepted my booking request immediately. After 6 minutes he called me and said ""You're going to Euston where has £15 congestion fee. Sorry, but I can't go there. You have to cancel it."" I didn't want to be late; therefore, I listened to him and made another booking. The second driver didn't even arrive at the destination point and replied to neither my call nor my massages, for this Ola applied £6 cancellation fee to my account. After 15 minutes, the third driver came and picked me up at a few steps beyond my first departure location. I called Ola to explain what happened and get the cancellation fee. Unfortunately, they didn't refund due to changing my first departure point a few steps and didn't understand it was the second driver's fault. The only thing they need to do is checking two locations on the map.  At the end of the day, I was 45 minutes late for my appointment:(

                Won't be using again. First time I used this cab service. Was offered £5 off. Driver was going wrong way and we offered him the postcode several times because he was going to a wrong address for some reason but he just wouldn't listen. He just told us the sat nav sometimes gives you a route to avoid traffic but it turns out he was heading to a completely wrong address. Should have been charged £7-£11 but it was £20 because of the seriously long and wrong route taken to a wrong address. With the '£5 off' it was still £15. Called the helpline and it was like she was not listening and answering questions I had not asked about the driver not turning up, it was bizarre. She could not speak English very well and had a heavy accent so was difficult to understand as well. Told me she would refund £1.85? No idea why or how she worked this out? Avoid at all costs!Update:After several emails back and forth they said they would give me a refund of £6.20. Have finally got my refund but I have deleted their app and won't be using again.

                Awful, I’m a key worker in the UK and have to get to work 4 times a week, while I can’t use public transport to get there, OLA has been the worst choice because they are taking two payments, one is in reservation for 7 days (7 days have gone, still haven’t received my money back) and other one is taken when I get out of the cab. So I one day I’m losing about 50£ to get to work and 50£ to get home. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND if you don’t want some unwanted surprises.

                First few rides have been okay, however.... I sent a taxi to meet my partner to bring her home, the driver decided to alter from the route twice and worried my partner as he started heading in the opposite direction. Ola decided that the fare was in parameters and reject my claim. Next taxi from work to home, I decided to track what routes were being applied. The primary route was ignored and the driver went in the wrong direction. The route then changed to go directly towards my home. The driver then started heading again in the wrong direction.Ola again made the decision that the fare was in parameters. It seems that they are encouraging drivers to take excessive routes to get more money out of customers.This is not good business ethics and is ripping people off. The worst thing about it is the drivers are also exploiting women alone, which can be a bit worrying. I called my partner whilst she was in the car and told her to ask the guy why he was travelling in the opposite direction. If I didn’t do that I dread to think what could have happened, the plastic all over the seats was something that also worried my partner. With covid 19 about, this could be because of that, however seems a bit excessive.Have decided against using Ola in the future as they clearly aren’t reliable or trust worthy.This raises the question as to whether ola drivers are properly screened prior to working.

Their discounts are a complete waste of time as the app barely functions correctly.After there customer service people kept telling me I was the problem when it came to not access my payment summaries only to find out later by the 10th phone call that they don't/refuse to let you see how much you have earnt in total, this should be illegal as you have no idea what they are doing behind the scenes.I wouldn't ever want to drive for them again, or deal with their customer service every in my life.GO WITH ANY OTHER COMPANY!

When I put call on mute, immediately, he dropped the call. I called back, explained again to another adviser. I was told, in 2 working days, £10 will be credited.After 3 days, I called them to find out. Adviser read a note of previous adviser and said, previous adviser made a note that ""i had a bad experience with rider and ride was unsafe"". But I had not reported anything like that but false note was created on my profile by previous adviser. I didn't mind losing £10 but now I'm scared of Ola's fraud.When company was launched in London, My friend selected Ola ultimate plan. He called Ola customer service for confirmation and he was confirmed on the phone. After a week when he didn't receive money as per plan. He called them and they said, he was not one of the first 1500 driver. So, he was put on another plan. When he asked to check the recorded phone calls, he was told that there was no phone call made or receive on that day and time.We get notifications for promotional offers in the morning. When they see more drivers are rushing for that offers, immediately they change the promotion.

                What a frustrating process to get register as a driver. I am stuck at ola registration portal just only 1 document is not updating on the system its happening since a month every time I uploaded the document system doesn't recognise it keeps bringing up old documents, customer services at the front end they have limited access to the system so they can't override the situation, when I ask who will do that in reply there was a silence means they don't know. You can't create account until your registration process doesn't get completed...WHY??? All the system in entire world they first starts from creation of an account and then people starts to put their details so when an issue comes up it can be picked and rectified. So I did send an email as well with attached documents in case if they are not able to pick up on their SUPER DUPER OLA system which have Aladin Ginie hidden inside who is not able to pick up the documents and can't update the system how funny is that...they can't override their own created system.....what a lame excuse....wow...and by the way none of their manager or supervisor available to talk its part of their corporate culture.....and we all know where this customer service department exist....which is not in UK...now they are advising me to go in their branch so they can upload the documents...I said fault is in your system not from my side so you better need to rectify it from your end rather than you want me to run around here and there I have uploaded and attached in email as well.....what else you want me to do?.....I think this year award should goes to OLA.....for the best performance and company of the year...forget about Uber, Bolt or Kapten….just only OLA cause their system is absolutely fool proof (in their opinion)...come on guys stop creating these stupid hypes......and by the way your packages are just for the short term as soon as the offer will go out of the window you will see the difference in the numbers of drivers....your guys are keep calling to sell these packages where the weekly price will go up for more than 300 pounds a week with no guarantee of minimum earning come on wake up or have some Red Bull.....have your maths right before you approach drivers over phone to sell these packages....you guys needs at least 2 years where you will have a decent customer base and you can work at the level of BOLT or Uber.....it is quite big to ask in the beginning......I was simply trying to get registered on OLA as a back up app not as a first app....my prime app will always be Uber then BOLT or Kapten….then may be some where OLA....lolzzz. For your kind information I am not representing Uber, Bolt or Kapten against you...its my personal experience about OLA.

Then booked a second cab to get to the airport and he did not end the journey until 15 minutes after the end time (we were already through security at the airport), I called the driver in this time to try and end the journey and he did not answer. I've emailed Ola several times to submit my complaint and they have not responded

                What a disappointing experience with this service! The driver didn't pick me up and when I called him to ask what's going on, he came up with the most ridiculous excuse that he could not find my address. The BIG problem with such a lame excuse is that my husband (who told me to try the app) had used the services of other OLA drivers before and all of them were ""lucky"" to have found our house... So NO, it has nothing to do with my address, it's about this failed system that allows a driver to choose to pick up a client and then to not honour the commitment.

Last night I used the Ola App to book a car (very similar to the Uber App) only to be told by the App sorry your driver has cancelled the trip. I promptly ordered another car only to be cancelled again by the driver. I was also notified via SMS of the cancellations. By this time I was not happy and called an Uber. The following morning I checked my bank account and to my dismay had been charged for two Ola trips.

                Scammers and liars in London, drivers please beware they promise to pay you incentive but don’t actually do. Unprofessional staff, kept on lying about the incentive and ola plans. They kicked me off from the plan without prior notice and kept on lying while day that it’s a glitch in the app.They didn’t pay me ride fare guarantee now I have a family to feed and bills to pay on weekly basis and I’m stuck in the situation where can’t get help from anyone. I worked more than 50 hours including peak hours and at the pay day staff kept lying I’ll get paid and at the end they just say no to the payments.Definitely not a company to work with.We don’t accept things like this in London that’s not how London works and Londoners definitely don’t accept such rude and cunning behaviour.Definitely taking them to court and lodging a complaint with TFL.They have breached the TFL’s trust and most of all people’s trust. If TFL keeps giving licenses to such con companies we’d be broke and starve.

So next thing as you all guys know there is no respect for cab drivers. As soon customer place order they think they owns your car and owns you. So those 4 guys start swearing at me and threating me that they will damage my car and myself as well so i start requesting please your ride is cancel so can you please leave my car but they we not gona leave my car until they will get the next driver. So when they got the next ride after 15 minutes they left all door opens they open the boot gloves box and run away. I spoke to ola they said relevant team will take action but nothing happened. Its request to all cab drivers we always complaining for money we need to thing about respect and life safety. People need to understand we are not slaves we deserve respect we are not obliged to listen everyone music we are not dj's our responsbility to drop customers from A to B thats it.

Putting questions like how I should pick bags and try and listen to every demand. The assessments are more like how drivers should be always on command of the riders because they pay 4 pounds for a journey. On top they continue to patronise by giving examples of how women are weak and we should do out of our way to help women because they are weaker breed. App support is very irresponsible and have no basic knowledge.

                The worst company ever! I booked a ride but the driver didn't arrive after a while. On the map, the cab was stuck in the middle of the route. I tried to reach the driver through phone call several times but he did not pick up the phone! I was getting too late that I had to cancel the ride. Rajat Jasra was the name of the driver who never came!Ola still charged me for no ride and I experienced a disgusting customer service they claimed that the money would be back to my account in tow weeks! but no response after two months! I would never take ola again!

Literally lacing it down the roads and harsh braking as if he’s getting chased by police. Joke of a app tbh. If you can’t handle the travel business just give up. No point trying to wow everyone over with a few coupon codes when you got dead drivers. No form of help on the app, can’t file a complaint as no one on the help desk is professional or skilled enough. Fix up.

What if it would have been a case of rape , kidnap or any other physical violence will you still listen to your drivers.I seriously will never ever book cab with ola as i do not feel safe any more and i will make sure to that i share this incident as much as i can so the people could think several times before booking any cab with you .My belongings were a gifts from my friends on my birthday that doesn't matter how much they cost however for me it was worth millions. and on other hand there was a Casio G shock watch was there in packet and gift package which i am not sure what was in there and a basket with full of beverages and eatables.The way your agent clearly denied to take any responsibly this shows what kind of customer service you offer and i am sure if somebody would be raped or either kidnapped this is how your response would be.Any crime is a crime no matter whether its rape or stealing .i am attaching the screenshot of the FIR which i made at the same time as per your first agent suggestion and the screenshot of the whats app msgs.RegardsRajat chhabra

                I had just one experience with Ola and have felt it’s enough. I used it’s app to book a ride at Auckland domestic airport. I couldn’t find the driver and he couldn’t find me. I called a couple of times, but it’s a landline and no one picked up the phone.. No mobile available to contact the driver and he didn’t bother to give me a call. The service was cancelled by the driver, but I had to be charged of the cancellation fee. Nowhere on the web or the app to ask for a refund. The policy is if the service is cancelled either by you within a minute after booking or by the driver if he can’t find you in five minutes, you have to pay $10. It’s really unfair and annoying because I took initiative to solve the problem, but the driver didn’t, however, i was charged for their problem. The service was bad and I have deleted their app, I prefer to pay more for a better service rather than paying less for a terrible service, needless to say paying for no service at all. Josie

                I’ve used Ola many a time, often with terrible service but they were always a fair bit cheaper than Uber with their constant discount codes in the app itself. I had such terrible service with them on one occasion I vowed never to use them again, when my driver was a complete lunatic and I felt really unsafe, particularly when we drove straight through a red light at a major junction. Customer services didn’t care but said I should’ve called them via the app’s ‘emergency’ button...as if you’re going to vocally say on the phone whilst in the car that they’re a terrible driver! I just got our early and walked to my destination. However, last night whilst I was having issues with my Uber app connection and had to get to a meeting, I ordered an Ola. It turns out their customer services don’t seem to care when one of their drivers is involved in a collision either, even with a passenger on board. I told them it wasn’t my driver’s fault, but they still said they would ‘educate the driver on safe driving practices’ and when I informed them I have a recording of the third party admitting to driving too fast, they said they’d email me to get a copy, but never did. They were more interested in whether I was going to sue them. As the meter had been running for the whole time that the drivers switched details and they argued for a bit due to the third party being slightly aggressive, I asked for a refund of my ride. £2.97 they offered me...to take the price to their minimum fare. Despite the fact I missed my meeting entirely, and was rather shaken up, they said there wasn’t anything more they could do because “I had completed the ride”!!! The app is being deleted and this time I am certainly never using them again! Avoid avoid avoid!!!N.B. According to the drivers themselves, Ola’s driver or ‘partner me service is also terrible so the company is making money from us without providing a good service either to the customers OR the drivers!! Why would we support that?!

Moreover they activated postpaid payment option on my account without my concern and inspite of paying cash to cab driver they deducted 90 rs. from that postpaid account. And now they are sending SMS and calling for due amount which was already paid in cash to driver by me. When I called Ola customer service they said you will have to pay amount as you did not report within 72 hours. Where as I was unaware about postpaid service been activated on my account by them. They are trying to fool customer. Worst experience.

","
                Yesterday I had a ride with OLA cab in North India from Gwalior to Bharatpur (150 km). The fare was 1200 INR above the estimated fare, because the driver charged 40 km more than he drove. I informed OLA cab about the incorrect billing by email, but they didn’t even send me a notice of arrival. Usually I book my transfers in India with trustable local taxi agencies or I asked the hotel to pick me up or to bring me to the airport. These transfers were always in time with trustworthy drivers and fair prices. I will stay away from OLA cabs in the future!

","
                I took Ola ride to my home on 2 of Jan. As soon as I recognized that my house key has been left in the car, I did contact Ola through all channels asking them to contact Ola driver(name and CRN of the driver given). However, it has been 3 days waiting for them to contact the driver. Actually, I believe that the driver should provide the trusted phone number. Trusted number means Ola can contact the driver anytime when any issue occurred. I do not understand how the driver can ignore the call from Ola.  As mentioned earlier, this is such a urgent and serious situation and I am the customer so Ola should assist me more to reach the driver asap. Now I feel taking ride with Ola is unsafe because when something unexpected happens, it seems Ola can assist nothing. What Ola did is to ask me to be patient, that’s why I have been waiting for three days since I first contacted to Ola. However, I got nothing from the driver. Again, I choose to take a ride with Ola because I think Ola is such a big platform which can contact and control the drivers. If today I got nothing back from Ola or if I cannot get the key back, I will stop using Ola for life and I want to share this matter to others explaining that Ola cannot have a real assisting to their customer. For my issue, spending 3 days trying to contact the driver, I cannot imagine if something worst happens to the customer while taking the ride with Ola, what you can do for your customer? I definitely say that you can do nothing, just only asking the customer wait. What I ask Ola is just contact the driver because I am sure that my key is in the car. I DO Disappoint with this service.

                Ordered a taxi for the first time from the app in UK. Waited for a long time before calling the driver to find out where he was. He told me he was outside but after further questioning found out he went to the WRONG location. He could barely speakEnglish which made it hard to communicate and then he hung up on me. He then cancelled my ride and I got charged £4, leaving me stranded and vulnerable on a busy friday night and I'm heavily  pregnant as well! This will definitely be the last time I'm using this company, should have just stuck to Uber who is reliable and communicates with their customers. NEVER AGAIN!

                Today I had booked a share cab from E-city phase-II to Ramamurthy Nagar. My Co passenger had to travel to Bannerghatta. The two drop locations were in the opposite direction. Because of that, I had to travel across bangalore unnecessarily for a extra 1h 15 minutes. Who will compensate for Mr lost time?  I could'not reach my destination in the right time. The whole purpose of Leaving the office ealy to complete my task is defeated. Who will compensate for my wasted resources? OLA customer service executives are not at all helpful to either resolve th issueor to compensate for the lost time, money, peace of mind. Ideally Ola customer care personnel said that they will send a link, where in which I get some Ola coupon for compensation for today'sride. In the link which has been shared, there is no provision to share the customer feedback. Today's my ride allotment was genuinely Ola's mistake, which they are not ready to accept. If Ola has any concern about customer satisfaction, they have to do the needful.

                I’m so disappointed with Ola’s scam artist drivers and the companies customer service. Than again, what customer service?? It’s non existent!I had a very bad experience with two dodgy drivers on the same day. I went to Melbourne for holiday and ordered an Ola from the airport to the closest train station for me and my Dad. I get a call from the driver asking me what my destination is and when I told him over the phone he cancels my ride!! So unprofessional and he shouldn’t have called to ask where I was going. I get another driver and upon hearing that me and my Dad are new to Melbourne he tells us that it would be much cheaper for us to change my ride til the final destination which is South Yarra and that it would only cost $35. I felt very hesitant to change my destination but he convinced me it wouldn’t be more than $40 max. I changed my destination but the estimated ride price didn’t show up!!! What a ridiculous app!! So I called customer service to find out an estimated price for my ride and they told me they can’t tell me over the phone and the driver kept saying ‘Don’t worry! It’s no more than $35. I just dropped off a rider to South Yarra and it cost him $35. If you get public transport for you and your Dad you’ll end up paying $40 anyway. It’s cheaper to get an Ola.’ Boy what a lie that was! When I reached my destination and the ride cost showed up it was almost $85!!!!Thing’s only got worse. I’ve opened up a dispute about the matter and only got a missed call from them at 12:45am when I was asleep!!! No other response since. I emailed customer service 3 times, and still no reply! It’s been 2 weeks!!! I’ve even called up customer service and was told somebody will get back to me but nobody has called me back since! I want a FULL REFUND this is bs!!! Never using Ola again I’m going to stick to Uber. They have much better customer service and solve issues immediately.

                Inexperienced driver got lost driving us to the airport in Melbourne, Australia. We were visitors and had to use our phones/apps to get us to the airport. The bill was $30 more than what was quoted in the app, and the driver said he would adjust but I should also contact Ola. Did as directed and received no response. I have subsequently tried to contact Ola over multiple days and using multiple methods.  Nothing has happened and they will NOT respond. Even tried to use their contact info related to safety concerns and was NOT able to get thru. Highly recommend that you Do NOT use this service.

My second to last trip, the driver needed to call me for directions. Actually, she called to tell me she had arrived. She hadn't. I gave directions over the phone, street by street until she got to me. I got into the car and , somehow, she cancelled the trip which saw me charged $7.70. The driver then asked me if I could pay cash for the trip. I only had a little over $22. The driver then called Ola for help. Hmm, nope, I had to get out and call for another driver. And contact Ola to TRY and get a refund. If I wasn't in a different state and my premmy grand daughters not in NICU I doubt I would ever use this service again. PS just received a refund, but no apology or discussion on the driver behavior.  Poor result.

                Arrived at Sydney Airport 25/11, used Ola Cabs, this is the second time I used them but NEVER EVER again! I thought first time might be just the individual driver himself and it was just my luck to have such a rude, aggressive driver but after yesterday, I tell myself NO WAY will I use Ola Cabs again. I was on a business trip from Melbourne and was going to a client meeting at a business centre. When I keyed in the name of the Business Centre, it came up on the Ola Map. When the Driver picked me up, he could not find the street number but he did not ask me and just ask me to get down on Ricketty St. I asked him is this the street number he said NO! you did not put any street number on the address so I just drop you off anywhere on Ricketty St! OMG! What kind of person is this! I then said you could have asked me instead of asking me to get off in the middle of nowhere. He then got off the car and grab my luggage from the boot and kicked me out of the car!!! This was the worst cab experience I ever had in my life and I am 55! I tried to call Ola Cab but there was no number, I wrote a complaint and until 3 days now, no one responded! Later on, I took an Uber, and the Uber driver told me Ola Cab was an Indian company from India and he refused to join them as this company is very unprofessional and support is non-existent. No wonder!

                Stay away from Ola outstations.Their drivers try to charge more by taking the longest possible route if call them on their bad practices then they make excuses or don't listen to you.  Plus their price estimations are an absolute scam. Booked a round trip cab to UP from Delhi prices estimation showed 3900+ taxes, the driver they sent was overall okay but would regularly change routes to cover more km. so they can charge more. on the way back their app got stuck and didn't show our return trip or the route to return trip. we called the help and they said they can't do much about it and we should use google maps.We got lost in a rural area on dirt roads once on the way back as the driver didn't know the way either, it was a huge Security concern as my parents were with me. Then their driver started saying sir CNG kam h detour lena pdega CNG ke liye and all, which added even more distance to our trip. In the end, we reached Delhi the app showed that we owed 6090 … plus taxes of 500 .. almost double the original amount. with a distance of over 180 km more than expected. I had to argue for an hour with the driver and with ola customer service to resolve to issue, they agreed only because their app was at fault and it was a security hazard coz we got lost on the way back  In an unknown area soo I said would seek legal options as I had the proof. Finally, I only paid the original estimated fee, because of their technical fault and poorly informed driver we could have gotten lost or had some other securities issue during our return trip. their Drivers on outstations service also try to take longer routes and rake as much km as possible so they can increase the trip distance. They converted our 300km round trip to a 480 km trip. because of the CNG debacle and saying that this the fastest route. later their app went dead and the driver misguided us even more. SO Final review STAY AWAY from their outstations service.

Discounts become less and less. I honestly loved this service at first so If you have never used them before please do but don’t become a loyal customer because they’re not loyal to you. Amateur drivers and bad service. I got charged £4.00 for a driver who picked up different people and there was no customer service number to call to rectify this. I lost money for someone else to have a free ride and still chose to use them but tonight I waited 8 minutes for a taxi to drive past me and then cancel because there was small traffic, when I was shouting to the car I was there ! am now on a train which I have a pass for. Would’ve preferred to give me money to ola but they clearly didn’t want it.

So they got a free ride home on my card, if you're reading this you're welcome. This basically means he didn't ask for a name or confirm the destination which should be pretty standard but, I guess not.

Until and unless you check the fare breakup you dont know what the exact reason why you are charged more.If you report this to call centre they are refunding the amount but if you forget to check the fare break-up then you are fooled.Looks like this is a strategy from Ola to keep it's drivers intact.

","
                Literally only reason I’m still using Ola is because they’re running offers cheaper than Uber. Drivers consistently cancel rides once accepted, they make you wait for more than one minute without moving so when you cancel, Ola charge you a £4 cancellation fee (But if you’ve waited longer then no refund after 5-10 minutes for a booked taxi and they cancel for no reason). 9/10 times you cannot contact the driver when you try as they’re always either on the phone to their friends or the app just tells you they aren’t booked. Drivers frequently accept you and then cancel if theres surging so you’re left with no cab and a higher fare when you rebook. Try and contact Ola support to feedback - good luck. Would take a doctors qualified person to figure out how to actually get in touch with them to tell them about their poor service.Bottom line - only use if you have no other option and don’t rely on them at all.

                I wish I had seen the reviews earlier but I needed a ride share app ASAP. I didn’t even take advantage of the “50%” off thing, I paid full price. Ola takes an estimated fare pre authorisation off your card then charges you so basically takes double the fare straight up then releases the pre authorisation amount days later. They tell you its released straight away but it definitely isnt and we ALL know banks take days to return these funds anyway - they should NOT be double charging. How ridiculous. The only answers you get from customer service are generic copy and paste answers. Definitely stick to Uber who have actually THOUGHT ABOUT how to run their business much better.

I watched in the app as the driver was sent around a block 2-3 times before finding his way to me. Then the app wouldn’t start for him, so we sat in his car for another 5 mins. But best of all this trip is still running in the app, 4 days later! I can’t book another and I guess I’m waiting for them to finish the trip and charge me my life savings in return for this spectacularly bad experience. Tried calling support; no answer. Tried emailing, they stopped replying. Just avoid them. Every driver (who is also an Uber driver BTW) says Ola is problematic. Oh, and Ola has a 6.2B valuation!? Come on now.

                Absolutely a disgrace of a company. You book. They then take your money immediately based on quoted price. This stays pending and charged in your bank account. Any additional fees such as time and traffic you are then charged and it’s usually massive. This also stays as a pending charged transaction. With in 2 days they then deduct full fee from your bank and LEAVE the pending charges. It’s apparently NOT their policy to contact your bank. You need to wait the 14 days for your bank to then release those pending charges. So if you don’t mind being charged twice and more than quoted than go ahead and use it. Ola make up toll charges and additional fees. So disgusting never use again. They have zero customer help. And zero policies on return methods.

                Ola NZ sucks. The worst car service I have ever used. I would award it zero stars but you have to rate it Bad its below bad.Took a Ola car from Auckland Domestic to Remuera. I was quoted $36-39 with the $10 off for new customers it sounded good.Not so the driver wouldn't take my directions. I said why are you going into the city? He said the GPS knows to fastest way. I figured so what I'm paying $39 with a $10 discount he can waste his gas.Not the case I guess they charge by the KM. I got out of the car POed with the driver. He took off pretty quick before the bill reached my phone. $55. He probably thought affluent area the guy won't notice or care. I emailed the company got a reply and a refund but only $15 which made my bill $40 no new customer discount. After the lying and cheating the ride should have been for free to teach the driver its not cool to rob your customers.It was my first and last time using this company Uber is far superior

We understand your concern regarding the charges applied for the ride bearing CRN 3591791821. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.

It included a $3 charge for parking when there was no parking. The driver didn’t even get out his seat to unload bags so definitely no parking for him, he remained in the drop off zone only. After frustrating blow offs from Facebook Ola, because there seems no other way to contact them, I received a $4 credit. Much prefer Uber. False advertising and the commerce commission should get in this before more people are ripped off large amounts.

I told the driver I did not want to pay for the extra distance and he assured me that the way the prices work is not based on km’s travelled but the distance from my house to the airport (lies). So then I got a bill of $42!! I told him I need a partial refund please and he kept arguing that the detour was only 3 minutes. More lies! He then went on to tell me I was the worst customer he’d ever had. He said he’d pay me $10 out of his own pocket if I promised not to report it to Ola. Which I never ended up getting. Very rude, unprofessional and misleading! I will never use Ola again!

                I used Ola for the first time last night.  The fare quoted was $25.  The driver dropped me off in the wrong location and I had to hail a taxi to get to where I wanted to go.  So I ended up paying double.  To make matters worse when I checked my credit card this morning Ola has charged me twice for two different amounts - both way above the $25 fare quoted!  Looking at the other reviews I think Ola is behaving in an unethical and deceptive manner.  Their claim that they are cheaper than Uber is clearly false advertising.  Also the fare quoted should be the fare paid - they should not be able to increase your fare once you have accepted the ride.  Last night was my first and last time using this company.  I will be sticking with Uber and Taxi Apps who are transparent about the fare before you accept the ride.

                We tried Ola for the first time a week ago, when we had to travel from Croydon (Sydney's Inner West) to the Sydney Domestic Airport.No problem with the timing, driver or vehicle, but the cost was RIDICULOUS!.I've taken a taxi on the same route many, many times over the years, and the cost has varied from about $35 up to $50.When I typed our pickup point and destination in to the Ola App, a price of something a little over $30 popped up straight away. ""WOW!"" I thought. ""These guys are amazing!!""However, as the vehicle (initially listed as being only 5 minutes away) got closer to our pick-up address, the stated cost as shown on my app increased to $40, and then, just as I was about to confirm the transaction to my cc, it suddenly jumped to well over $60!I confirmed, as the vehicle was arriving, and I didn't want to stuff the driver up, but I wasn't at all sure by then exactly HOW much I would end up paying, as the promo information stated I was entitled to a 50% discount for the first two weeks of Ola travel. I later looked at the fine print and saw that that 50% was limited to a mere $10.Whoop-dee-doo.I'm now back home from my trip, and have checked my cc statement. I was charged $62.05, but there was a separate, additional Ola charge on my statement (for the same day) of a further $5.09.So - total fare = $67.14What the....???!!!And the driver was happily telling us on the trip to the airport how much CHEAPER Ola was than either Uber OR a taxi service!I feel totally suckered by Ola, and will not be using them again.Incidentally, on our return to Sydney, we did exactly the same trip in reverse, back to Croydon by taxi, and it cost us $46.00.Say no more....

First driver arrived after 5 minutes, not bad I thought but he managed to drive his wheel on the kerb and all I could hear was air coming out of his tyre so clearly I couldn't use his service. He asked me to cancel the taxi and order another one. I did that and for some reason the payment method was not valid anymore (I used the same card for the previous order so I don't know what happened there) I've tried to use another card and then had a message that the price increased. Never mind I thought and I tried to book it but it turned out there  were no drivers around. In a meantime message arrived that I've been charged cancellation fee for the first taxi. I was trying to sort it out and my phone run out of battery so in the end I had to take a black cup that costed me double the price.  Definitely not worth the hassle.

                My parents were travelling by Ola Cab to Pune railway station. The driver was drunk, talking rudely and abused them for no reason. He delayed the trip intentionally so that they could miss train. He purposely created trouble for them through out the ride by stopping the car at multiple places. Ola Cab is going to shut down soon because of its poor service. Uber is quiet professional as compared to cheap Ola.

                Terrible. Before you confirm booking, the app shows multiple cars in the area and tells you a car is 1 or 2 mins away (in my experience). Once you confirm and payment is authorised, the car was shown as 9 mins away. We were running late but chose to wait. We watched the GPS and the app showed the car going backwards and forwards in the same position for 8 minutes, but the estimated arrival stayed at 6 mins! 20 minutes after we ordered, we called the driver and he advised he was still 9 minutes away due to traffic! This was the second time ordering an Ola - the first experience was the same but we gave Ola the benefit of the doubt and tried again because of the 50% off for 2 weeks promotion.  Cancelled the Ola and reverted to Uber. The Uber app told us the car was 2mins away - and what do you know? We were picked up in 2 mins. We'll stick to Uber thanks, and will recommend everyone stay with Uber! Sorry Ola drivers who were pushing us to use Ola for the better commission rate for drivers.  Customer experience is key!!! The app does not accurately reflect ETA and is misleading. Uber is definitely a superior customer experience!

I told him the pickup address was at 402 Newcastle St Northbridge, as per what I entered. He again told me where he was waiting for me and that his GPS was correct and I was wrong.After about 4 minutes of explaining where I was and how to get to me, he said he was coming (all he had to drive was 850m west along Newcastle St to where I was). After waiting for 10 minutes, I tried calling him and I recieved a message that he could not be connected. I tried calling him 3 or 4 times more without success. Soon after I got a cancellation notice and charged a $10 cancellation fee.Apart from mgetting charged for somethng that was not my fault, the more upsetting part was that I had to deal with such a rude person who just cancelled and blocked my number.I tried contacting OLA and support is non-existant, every time I follow instructions as to what I need to do I receive a message that the server is down. I contacted UBER who came immediatley and got me to my function ontime no thanks to OLA.I have added a screenshot of the driver ""WAJDI ALNAJJAR: White ix35) avoid him at all costs.

Since OLA has refused to pay me for the service that I have provided, there is not much else that I can do but to warn everyone else who is considering using OLA app.•	I had a rider who booked and I picked him up, advised me I will be his personal driver for the night.•	Went different locations with toll charges and drove for more than 10 hours around Brisbane and North side went through Clem 7 and most of the tolls around Logan area.•	My role as a Ride share driver partner is to drive clients from A to B. It is not my duty to track and record the movement of the vehicle from location A to B or record.•	It is not my duty to chase payments from clients directly. It is legal requirements and a contract between driver partner and The Plat form provider (OLA). OLA Company is obligated to obtain payment for the transportation service that we (drivers) provide to members of the public who book through the app. In my experience OLA has failed me in this regard.I have made numerous attempts to find out why I was not being paid for the work I have done and response from Ola customer care was very poor and unprofessional.•	I have also attached Toll charges for the night. The client who booked me at the beginning stayed with me throughout the 10 hour period and all of the passengers he asked me to transport asked me not to finish the trip and kept changing the address.•	On the second day, the previous client called me to hire my service for the whole night again. When he tried to book through Ola App it did not work for him. I contacted Ola but was told there were technical problems.   I then encouraged him to use Uber as I drive for both companies; however he was a bit hesitant.•	He was using different names and calling different people using codes and always checking his phone and mentioning numbers a lot. Whenever he was purchasing food or drinks he would send others with just credit card information and no card, just orders Online.  He was using Melody. A few times businesses like KFC declined to process order, he insisted he paid online but the manager said you need to pay here because that money did not go through. The client said let’s go, he conned Hungry Jacks business and ordered a lot of food. At this point I began to suspect something was not right. When I realized I was dealing with an organized syndicate who were into defrauding businesses and citizens by using stolen credit card information. •	After finalizing pick up for one of his friends I asked him to rebook again but he was unsuccessful.  After 7 hours of driving they couldn’t order through Ola or Uber and I told them can’t help you if you can’t make a request for one of the service.•	I called Policelink to report suspicious behaviour and made police statement and I am currently waiting for CCTV videos for the locations the client took me. If OLA does not pay me.   I am sharing my experience with Current Affair Media so OLA can be exposed for its dodgy business practices not to mention the unprofessional and incompetent reception drivers like me get when it comes to paying us the fees owed to us.•	I highly commend UBER Ride Share Service as I have received every cent I made with Uber App in 24 hours but have not received a cent from Ola. •	OLA has admitted that they do not have the capacity to track vehicles using their app so please consider your safety if this is the case whether you are the driver or the rider.Just to warn my fellow driver partners please don’t drive Ola cabs as they rip you off and the hard working citizens of this beautiful land.

                it has been a long time ago, I booked Ola for my trip from Sunshine to the city. I was waiting for a long time and the driver just went around and he could not pick me up. It took 20' to wait and then the driver canceled my trip. I was charged $9.56 with no reasons. I deleted Ola app because I dont want to use it anymore. however, I received an invoice with EBT COLLECTION COMPANY. The invoice  I received again with amount is $14.24??? what wrong with that company? They are a terrible driver company ever. I never use it again.

I then received a email receipt saying I had been charged because he ‘done the ride’ he put it through and lied about doing it.

Secondly, if you are lucky and got hold of them they don’t do anything. They have just a script they read that they are sorry for the inconvenience. They understand my frustration, they have forwarded the query to the relevant team, they raised issue through their supervisor so it would get resolved soon HOWEVER in reality this all is a just lies they tell you. They don’t have any process in place for the complaints. I asked them many times to raise my complaint they did not. I spoke with their So-called supervisor named Aashoo on Monday this week he advised me that the issue is with top management with high ups and it will get resolved by Wednesday however it’s Friday nothing progressed. He also promised me a call back but did not happen. I am so annoyed that they don’t note the calls on account & I have to explain story again every time. A rubbish company to work with would never refer anyone Ola.

When we got our hotel in Sydney City, we were charged up to $36 with other fees mysteriously appearing on our account. The 50% off was actually 50% off upto a maximum $10. What a bunch of rip offs. We tried contacting them but they have no contact number. We were told on the website to send an email. We arrived at our hotel at 3pm. We got a messages back from them at 930pm.

Driver ignored my texts and calls the next day, despite telling me he would drop it at a station. 48 hours later, I contact police who contacted the driver. An hour later my laptop was at the station. NEVER will I use again. Ola does not have a phone number and I had FIVE different staff members contact me!!

I got a response asking for my IMEI number, gave it, and ... silence.After a few days I emailed again to open a new ticket, including the IMEI up front this time, and ... silence.Did the same and opened a third ticket ... silence. Finally started tweeting at them, super responsive until I actually gave them my info to look up my account/tickets, at which point they just tell you to please give their “concerned team” a bit more time and then just leave you on read.Followed up on the emailed tickets again last night and finally got a response ... asking for my IMEI number. Yes, for real.I’m leaving Australia tomorrow so at this point wish they would just delete all my data. Thank god I could at least unlink Ola from my payment source on PayPal’s side or I wpuld have been really screwed.Wish I read the reviews here before getting into this mess. It’s the kind of cluster that gives us Indians a bad name — it’s why if I had known this was an Indian co, I’d have known to avoid in the first place.

                (This review is based purely on my experience and opinions)I used OLA cabs a few times and was unhappy with the quality of the app which kept crashing and freezing. Sometimes i would i have to wait over 30 minutes just for a ride which displays a driver being ""2 minutes away""After i stopped using the app a charge was made to my card of which i did not use anymore. i did not purchase a ride and did not even have the app on my phone. luckily this charge did not go though due to moving money to another bank account. Rather than investigating and listening to my claim i was contacted by a third party via a letter of demand for payment for the unpaid fare that was not mine! despite me informing them that this was likely a fraudulent charge they still have not responded to me directly.I would be very careful. After doing research i found that Ola is not a taxi or cab service rather a corporate rideshare business from india.

                Ola in New Zealand must be the worst ride sharing app service ever! They used to be good but their drivers are letting down the service. They deliberately take much longer to pick you up than the indicated time. App said 2 mins, and I've been waiting over 15 mins. Their driver location shows they are even further away from where they should be! Abuse of the system by the drivers.

                I had worst experience today. I took a cab from Vashi (Navi Mumbai) to Matunga. I selected the payment method as online payment (Debit Card) of Rs. 315. Once I reached the destination I informed CAB driver that I made online payment. He said "" Ma'am pehle bolna chahiye tha na abhi nahi hoga. apko cash payment hi karna padega"". I said the amount is already deducted from account and payment is done. Still he was not ready to listen. He said you need to pay amount in cash and the amount which was deducted will get refunded in 10 minutes once you call a customer care support number of OLA. I had to pay Rs. 315 in cash. Since then for last 2 hours I am trying to call customer care support but the number is busy and there is no other way to get in touch with them. In OLA payments it's showing I paid Rs. 315 only.I want to know1. Will I really get my money back or it's gone?2. Where is the record of paying Rs.315 from my account?3. What is the number to get in touch with OLA?4. Is there any procedure like when you make online payment you need to pre- inform the driver that you're making the payment online? Because in Uber you can directly do that.

                I took Ola for the first time twice yesterday and somehow managed to get 2 drivers in a row who tried to hit on me! The first driver was really nice and we had a great conversation, however at the end he asked me if I had Instagram?? How unprofessional. The second driver was friendly(/flirty) too and in the conversation I ended up telling him I was going back to my boyfriends for the night. After that he stopped being flirty but switched tactics and started asking me how to meet girls. When I told him I met my bf on tinder he asks me to look at his tinder profile and so I could tell him if it was good enough. I wasn’t too bothered but I did feel kind of uncomfortable. Right at the end he asked me to give him a 5 star rating and was very pushy. He asked me to stay in the car after we stopped so I could give him 5 stars. I showed him I did but I didn’t press submit and gave him a much lower rating which I thought was better suited to his unprofessional behaviour. If I do decide to get Ola again it won’t be alone, still an option I guess cos it’s really cheap

                I was in Birmingham UK to go see a gig with a mate. We got called over by a group of ola representatives, claiming to offer us a free ride. They kept saying they would take us to the centre of bham for free on little converted mopeds, despite us already being in the centre. We then asked to be taken to the location we required which they then stated they would. Once on the moped, the driver said he wasn’t allowed to take us anywhere as we were only on his moped for promotional reasons. We drove around for 5 mins in a circle, ending up in the same place whilst people took pictures and videos. We then got told to download the app and sign up with their promotional code for a free ride, so we did. We waited 30 mins for a taxi that never arrived. We tried calling the driver and messaging them with no reply. The representatives there at the time just kept telling us to wait, and when I began to show my dissatisfaction, the manager there on the ground told the staff they had to move away from us and focus on obtaining new customers. The worst taxi experience I’ve ever had. The company is focused on money and promotion, but the service they offer is highly lacking.

                        OLA - Worst Service Ever For Customers
                
","
                I have been using OLA for the last 4-5 years and they have been helpful to me always for the exceptional cases where when I was charged more for the trip that I shouldn't just on a call they have refunded the difference amount.That's been the case with Ola Money Wallet. As they have launched Post Paid things have changed drastically. Not been an OLA Fan anymore. I booked a cab via OLA using Ola Post Paid. While booking, I was showed that the estimated fare would be 129 INR around while the trip was ended it came to surprisingly 250 INR.That happened with Post Paid. When I called their customer support I was told that this was because of the rise in fare which is completely false. Because whenever they increase their fare or the prices are up, you see that at the time of booking. They notify you beforehand.The fact was the driver was driving too slow and because of that the trip which was supposed to get over in 15 mins extended to 35 mins.I told them about the issue on call but they ignored it.For one more trip, the driver came to the stop to pick me up, I didn't get the notification for the same and was charged 30 INR extra as waiting fees.Come on if your driver has came to the pick up spot, he has to call at least, or at least notify me on mobile that the cab is here like you guys usually do.This is disgusting. Even now a days, if you have to call their customer support, you have to go through a lot of FAQs first and then only you are able to call them.Disappointed.Not favorites anymore.

                        Deceitful company
                
","
                My first and only experience with Ola was fairly straight forward to begin with - I had a $20 voucher to use as an incentive to try their ride share company for the first time. The app is fairly easy to use, and once the destination was punched in I was given an estimated fare. The ride was fairly standard, and all seemed fine, until I got home and found I was charged an additional $29.52 “fare increase” with no warning or explanation. The app offers no avenue to query or challenge the fare, apart from some unhelpful FAQ’s. After sending a message to Ola via Facebook I received a generic copy and pasted reply which only proceeded to patronise me by telling me that I was charged a higher rate because at the time I booked my trip it was busy, and all of this fare information was provided to me when booking the trip ... This information is only visible by clicking the minuscule ‘i’ on the fare total screen for more information, rather than being presented on the summary screen prior to requesting the Ola as you would expect. Ola knowingly hides this information so as to elicit additional funds from unsuspecting riders. This is dishonest and deceitful conduct. If the total fare is going to be increased due to surge pricing then Ola has the responsibility to clearly indicate this on the fare estimate screen at the point of booking the trip. It is not the user’s responsibility to navigate several layers deep to find that their fare may possibly increase.I strongly recommend you never use Ola, and instead try Uber, Didi or any of the other many competitors.

                        As a relatively long time user of Uber
                
","
                As a relatively long time user of Uber, I was pleased when I was heard about Ola a rival company. Uber is so handy, safe and easy to use it's only due to this that I kind of put up with the fact that they clearly aren't a super nice bunch of people. One of the main issues I have with Uber is their fare multipliers. I have gotten to the point when I find alternative ways to travel when I am told I will have to pay a higher fee due to the service being busy, seemingly as a kind of punishment as is dealt out to commuters in the Uk by train companies for going to work at the time they are told. The Uber driver that recommended Ola to me said I would get a £10 voucher for using it for the first time so I downloaded the app and gave it a go (i'm in Bristol, Uk). On the apps first use, I stood there for a while waiting for it to find me a driver and after about 2-3 mins it hadn't so I gave up and booted the Uber app. After I got home, I got a call from an unknown number which turned out to be the Ola driver that had obviously come to pick me up despite me cancelling the ride (this was after about half an hour), closing the app and then going in an Uber. He was not very pleasant on the phone and I eventually had to hang up. I looked for a customer service number for the Uk and there isn't one. Not one. There are two India based customer service numbers but not one for the Uk. I wasn't going to phone India at my cost to complain about the abuse.I've used Ola a couple of times since then and the fares are always about 10-15% more expensive than Uber and the app is poor to say the least so I decided to go back to Uber. Last night I went to Uber and they had a 1.2x multiplier on (overcharging because they can) so I went back to Ola. I booked a taxi which the app told the driver to go to the adjacent road despite making it very clear that it knew where I actually was standing (there is no pick up point editing like on the much better Uber app). I was taken just over a mile and a half, a journey that usually costs me £6-6.50 on a normal Uber day and this morning I got a receipt for £9.49 (!!!!). I had to email Ola (as they don't like talking to people from the Uk evidently) and to be fair, I got a callback from them within a couple of hours. The Indian guy listened as I asked why the price was so high and he explained that there was a 1.33x multiplier on. In the Uber app, this is made very clear (as are other details that are much harder to read on the Ola app for me) but I didn't notice it on the Ola app. Maybe this was my fault but I am relatively astute so I think it's more a case of their app being noticeably inferior to the competition. The Indian man quoted everything in dollars and cents and I had to repeatedly explain to him that the Uk doesn't use Dollars and cents. He constantly mispronounced my name and claimed he was in the Uk after finally admitting he was from an Indian call centre (it's not good to lie). He offered me £5 as an apology which I refused and then upped it to £10 which I also refused. I told him that I thought Ola was the poor cousin to Uber, the app is crap, the customer service is rubbish and the fares are more expensive than Uber. Anyone wanting to jump ship to Ola would be advised not to bother unless you like poor quality and prefer to pay more for it.

                I want to share my todays WORST experience with OLA.I booked an auto and to at least 20 Kms from my destination.I added OLA money and after the driver ended the ride i came to know that ola money is not added and he asked me to pay cash.The atm was 2 kms away and i was getting late,i said him multiple times but he was stuck on the same thing.He gave me his paytm number but the limit was exceeded of his own paytm of accepting the money.Some how i managed to arrange cash and paid him.Now i am trying to book an auto or a cab but it's not allowing me to book as it says that i have not paid the previous amount.It shows ""Payment Pending"",i will have to pay then only i can book the other rides.Means it just ""Wow"" ,i paid cash,i had ola money,i tried paytm,nothing works out but still it says me pending payment,what an excellent service is provided after charging such huge amt of money.Paying is not an issue but no comfortability is surely an issue.The another thing i have noticed is that the auto drivers will never accept ola money,over the phone they say they need cash or else we can cancel the ride.Now we have to go according to the ola people and they will not go according to us.Another thing is one of the auto driver ended the ride before my destination as i asked him to wait for a minute as i had some work.he ended the ride half way and all my ola money was deducted.I would never recommend OLA rides to anyone,also as it is it's not allowing me to book a ride because of pending payment even after paying the money is cash. And then they want good rating.Keep your services up and then ask for rating.WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.

                Still awaiting a reply from Ola. Got charged $153 for a fare that normally costs $40. The kicker was that I never even got in the cab. They took someone else instead. So not only had to walk several kms home and take a train but somehow ended up $153 in the red. When asked what happened they said the driver took someone else instead?? This is an ongoing joke between me and my girlfriend, however a big warning to people. Customer service is rubbish. I have been promised several times that a supervisor would call me but never did. Has been 3 months and I don't expect them to ever reply. I am finally going to Consumer Affairs in Australia. Yes this app is cheaper but sooner or later you'll get burnt like me.

                caught an Ola cab that said it was going to cost me $13 for the fare total. I had a coupon to get 50% off so then the quote was down to       $6-7. now I know that isn't much for a cab, but this was for a Saturday night at midnight heading into town with uni students. I thought a great deal and ordered it. on Monday I saw that I had been charged $13 which was the original quote, but that was with the coupon applied. so I took it to them and said hey, I would like a refund for the difference you charged me as I was quoted this amount and then charged this. easy, right. no, it's only $6 but being the poor, stubborn uni student, I wasn't letting this slide. they replied with 2 different excuses, saying the first being that we took a deviated route, which was true but that wasn't our problem, that was the route the driver chose to get us there. and the second excuse was that they had a 1.5 peak fare pricing added, which was not disclosed when I ordered it, and then said they have transparent pricing. bullsh#t. that is not transparent pricing, that ripping off a poor uni students bank account. emails have been sent back and forward without getting anywhere. would NOT recommend this cab company unless you want to be ripped off and charged double you were quoted on. will not be ordering again.

They were half way in the middle of nowhere and the driver asked to get down and book another cab as he was running out of fuel. I spoke to customer care rep and it seems like they are least bothered about customer safety and satisfaction. I am very disappointed with the experience and will never book a ride again in future, neither I would recommend any one to book.

The worst part is driver was not even driving to my direction. No customer service, no body answering phone call. Worst service Ola in NZ.

                Hire proffessional drivers.. Last day I had an emergency and booked a ola cab. The cab driver called me that he would be at my pick up point in 5 minutes and asked where was the drop and somewhere I figured that he wouldn't turn up. He was at my location. When I went towards the cab, he moved to the other side of the road and moved the cab away from my location. I called him he answered my call and wouldn't speak at all. He played around me for about 7 minutes to show that I was not boarding the cab or to delay so that would be my mistake. I cancelled the cab giving the reason as he refuses to pick me up. 2nd driver when called him spoke to me so rudely that I was traveling for free. He says "" he would take 10 minutes to come if interested wait or else cancel the cab"". But in the map it was showing that he was a minute away and when asked him he says ""Didn't I tell that you should wait"".Your support sucks. So safely your company plays around. You don't even have a valid support number either on your website or the ola app. I hope your company should be shut down shortly looking at the reviews and ratings.Here is the driver's details where you wouldn't even care but do see it - silver Indica, vehicle#: KA05AE 6475Driver's name: NandeeshDriver's contact: +919071888753

                The last time i caught an ola has scarred me and i will not use their service again. I doubt very much the driver had a licence,  his skills were so bad, I feared for my safety. No indicating,  last min changes of lanes, not checking if the lane was free before moving. Horrendous! Furthermore he was unable to follow navigation. My journey from pyrmont to hunters hill went via glebe rather than straight over Anzac bridge and we almost made it back onto Anzac bridge when he suddenly swerved to exit onto Anzac bridge rather than follow the nav to victoria road. I had to direct him numerous times on a simple journey even though he was following the nav.  I left a detailed 1 star review and ola never contacted me, they obviously don't care about their customers. Never again!!!

                        Payment scam! - DOUBLE charge
                
","
                OLA charges you the quoted fee via ADYEN finance system then they charge you a final price when the trip is compete. So you’re charged twice until one of them disappears from your credit card. This takes up to 5 days. ** Here’s how it goes:When you books OLA, it gives you a quote which seems a lot cheaper than Uber. In the end, it’s nearly the same as Uber. You need to authorize the quote fee (payment) to proceed with the booking - there’s a disclaimer flashing when you ok on the quote and it disappears so quickly and you can’t even read properly. Once the trip is compete, it’s always a lot more expensive that the quoted fee. After the completion of the trip, I realized that I was charged twice - quote and final fee. Both says pending on my credit card. After 4-5 days, the quoted fee charge disappears and you’re only charged the final fee. So I gather that OLA is benefiting by holding my money for a few days. They’re doing this to all OLA riders which will become a very substantial lump sum. I’d call this scam.

I honestly wrote it off to be a scam email, as I had settled the account (also, I had used the free ride). Within the week, I am receiving debt collection emails for not only my account, but for a second account, which is not my account, but for the same amount of money owed on my account. The debt collection agency won’t wipe it, and I’m not dealing with a clunky system of emailing, instead of being able to ring someone and sort this out straight away. I’m not happy, as this affects my credit rating. Poor form Ola. I don’t care if it is rectified; I shouldn’t have to deal with this mess in the first place. Never in my life have I had a debt collector after me, and have a pristine credit rating. Now it is taking too long to deal with this rubbish.

OLA rides are not safe enough now, Specially for Ladies.Today, I had booked an OLA Cab for my wife from Sector 78, Noida to New Delhi Railway Station, Paharganj. Their were 4 incident happened very badly and details are given below.1)   Driver was driving so fast and was just about to hit another car on Dadri road. 2)   Driver stopped a cab after just 5mins. driving without permission/intimation for pee on the road, usually they have enough time before starting their journey for all of these and the waiting charges applied to the passenger.3)   He didn't pay the MCD toll tax from Noida to Delhi and ran the car, where as OLA charged us Rs. 100/- usually.4)   Now this is really not acceptable, Driver had dropped the passenger at the Ajmeri Gate without information, when the booking was done for Paharganj. And Ajmeri gate station was too far from where he dropped. Because of his stupidity, Passenger had missed her train. And When passenger asked him to drop Paharganj side, he denied and said their is a traffic jam that side and he totally ignored the passenger's need.Driver Details:D. name : Irfan HaiderD. Mobile No. 7533935653Cab no. DL ** ** 6955One more thing, OLA has also charge for AC in winter season where their driver are not using AC in winter. Instead, they open car window to get all pollution in the cab and doesn't care about passenger. When Passenger try to say switch on the AC on normal temperature, they say, it's already winter and no need of AC.Me, my colleagues, family and friends are are not going to use OLA services from now onwards.

                1. Pricing is too high.2. Drivers are not proper. Before starting a ride, driver will ask whether it is OLA money, cash or postpaid. If we say OLA Money, then some will cancel the trips and others will take a longer route. They do not listen to the customers. If the distance is too far, they will cancel the trip again. 3. My issue is still not resolved. I ended up paying 700 rupees extra for a trip of 25 kms. Ofcourse, you guys trust your drivers more than the customers. Driver took cash of 450 rupees and at the same time ola money was deducted and 450 rupees was charged to my postpaid account. During this trip driver was waiting down to change my trip location and he did not move an inch until I changed the location. Is this the safety you're providing to female travelers? Moreover, he was saying madam I will get extra amount, so that I do not have to go for another trip kindly change the location to my home. 4. Drivers teach us the routing to our homes also. They will not go in the route which the customers want and they will stop the cab in between at 10.30 PM. Do they have sense? I am not going to use OLA services anymore. Too many worst experiences with this service provider. I have raised many of these issues several times, but nothing has been done from your end. The customer executives will say you will get a call back today and that today will never come. For a trip of 600 I ended up paying 1200 which is the worst. Trust your drivers. Uber is much better in pricing. Coupons provided cannot be applied. Worst drivers and worst services.

I have looked up and noticed we are going to the completely wrong way than where I booked, I asked him what he was doing and where was he going and he told me that it had been booked for somewhere different (when it was not) he told me I had to change the drop off point which I told him I did not know how to do as I haven’t used them for long, he then cancelled my booking and told me to look for a new one, when I did this it was double the price as before which I then asked if he had a contact number with his boss or with someone I could speak to so I could explain what had happened to see if they was able to transfer the discount over or something, then he turnt round to me and told me to ‘get the f*** out his car’ ‘he was the driver so he could tell me what I can and can’t do’ and shouting abuse at me, I am an 18 year old girl and of course a grown man shouting abuse at you is going to make you upset, which is what happened to me, he left me on the side of a road, somewhere I had no idea where I was, my phone was about to die, and I had loads of shopping with me, luckily I was able to use a women’s phone to phone my partner and he was able to order me a taxi from the petrol station down the road!, anyway when I finally got home I sent a email to Ola regarding what had happened, I then got a phone call to be told the have no records of the first booking baring in my he said my full name so how would he of had those details otherwise??, absolutely horrible service!!, would not recommend!

                Cheaper than competitors. But the booking process drives me up the wall with the frequent cancellations. Don’t bother referring friends. Referred 3 friends so far, but because the rides keep getting cancelled by the driver/app, the referral code becomes invalid for that user when they have to book another cab.

I was at the t2 termial at approx 20:30hrs getting a cab at that point had become a big task for me. i was upset as my ride got cancelled i was yelling at the tall built guy at the parking wasim khan but must say high tolerence power helpful, quick with a solution to the problem. I personally waana apologise for my behaviour at the parking to him, but he didnt utter a word back, and was very helpful. must say good customer service .

By the time you realise the APP doesn't work you get stung $10. This occurred on several occasions so I decided to delete the APP....and then only end up getting chased by their debt recovery agency for a $10 cancellation fee- absolutely extortion. Take you business elsewhere!

I've had a drama with uber but they were very helpful and happy to provide a refund for their mistake.I have also had a driver once accept a ride which said he was 11 minutes away after 7 minutes the car hadn't  moved position, I thought my screen was playing up. I called the driver and he asked where I was going and If I still wanted him to come, sounding like he'd hope I'd cancel. He then took another 5 minutes to leave the same spot on the map, making me wait about 25 mins for my ride.

                If i could rate Ola Cabs a ZERO, then I would.The driver (name is Mohammed) I had was at first very friendly, he let me listen to my own music and have a little sing a long in the car. I was with a family member and we were returning from the city after a night out back to the suburbs, so we were a little tipsy as we had had a few drinks. The trip was anywhere from 45-50 minutes, so the driver was chatty and friendly - no issue with him at all. However, the situation changed as we turned into my street. As I left the vehicle, I realized that I had left the iPhone adapter in the AUX cord, so i turned about around i retrieved my item. As i bent over to get my item back, the driver felt the need to squeeze my left breast. I obviously screamed and shouted at him and asked him if he thought this was ok. He then took off and sped around the corner.Not only is this unacceptable... it is sexual misconduct/assault. I did not ask him to touch me or give him any reason too. As the Ola was booked under my  family members account, we made a complaint the next day via the app, however that was maybe 3 weeks ago now and we STILL haven't heard anything back. I will NEVER use Ola again. I have told all of my friends who have now deleted Ola from their phones. Ola is a disgrace of a company and cannot believe they employ drivers like him. Do Ola even complete background/police checks before hiring these people.

There were also lots of other little charges including “tax” which in WA is GST and should by law be quoted in the price.

                This company is an absolute joke. I have tried to book rides on two occasions and have had a total of $150 or more taken from my account in preauthorised transactions (which is gone for several days before being returned due to bank policies) for a total of 1 ride worth just over $20 being actually received. All of these charges are due to Ola cabs unreliable drivers continuously cancelling after accepting jobs to take jobs worth more money. This is completely unacceptable behaviour when payments are preauthorised upon accepting a ride. I will never be using this garbage app again. And guess what you can’t even contact them by phone to lodge a complaint, they are only reachable by email. Probably because they know that they would receive constant angry calls from customers. In the several years i have used Uber i have never had a single experience like this.

                This is regarding the drivers that ola has hired and the service that ola is providing here in INDIA. First of all i would start with the riders ola has hired: Most of them are unprofessional. Does not even know the basic driving rules. Reckless driving and there unprofessional behavior is a pain.No safety gears have been provided particularly in the case of bike rides.In case of any accident or damage to you and your belongings, here is a good news you call support and ask for any compensation the just pass calls from one person to another and then at the end Ola executives starts to dictate there term and conditions. As per my today's experience, I booked a bike ride in Noida. Bike rider did not had any extra helmet or any safety gears. Drove me to my place and in between bumped into a care due to carelessness of both parties.My hand was wounded phone was broken, Biker got up and started to ride. He was concerned about completing the ride. The Car driver ran away. When i talked to OLA customer care about this and asked about any insurance or coverage for the accident, The answer i received is embarrassing, "" Sir we are sorry as we are unable to help you as per our policies. We do not have any Insurance for the customer. We will take action toward the rider and you may go, launch an FIR and we will provide support if required.""This is how these Companies making money. They are not concerned about there customers. I am very furious and angry on the Indian government as how they issue licence to these companies. No insurance, What the hell wrong with the policy makers and the one who review and approve such things.The condition of the vehicle, skill set of the driver, Safety of the customer, Fares all compromised.Fares goes up and down as per there convenience  and you can never be sure about the consistency in there ride fairs.To the people who drive on road, Kindly look toward the person got injured by you or any on else. It may be your mistake or may be any one else committed the accident. Just do not run away. Talking can solve many problems and do not think that running away will solve your problem. Just help the person got injured. Extend a kind gesture and half the problem will be solved.Its my request to Indian Government to consider my request and check for the loop holes in the policies of these companies.For the reference to OLA : CRN 2438336349.

                The most useless way to get homeThis email I sent them explains my story4 friends and I went to a concert in a less than desirable suburb, all of us too young to drive and the public transport in the area not coming for another hour and a half. We planned to walk to a location and order an Ola to the train station and then get the train home. We signed up for the app and as there were five of us we tried to order a large Ola. We had two people on separate devices looking to order and after about 15 minutes the app told us that there aren’t any 6 seaters available. That was ok, so we decided to order two small cars and go in two groups. The first person ordered and came. The map on the app was completely wrong saying their driver was in a completely different location, and when the driver arrived they stopped in the middle of a main road and got my friends to get in there, even though there was a carpark right next to us which we asked him to pull in to. After that the three of us tried to order another one. We were connected to our first driver who was 11 minutes away to begin with. He called me to confirm my location? Even though I had already placed It in the app, and then as soon as we got off the phone he drove the opposite way to us and after 5 minutes of watching the driver go the complete wrong way he cancelled and we had to wait 10 minutes for the app to find us a new car. The next car again was 9 minutes away and driving the completely wrong way down the main road we were on. I called this driver to ask why he was going the wrong way and he told me to just wait a few minutes. He then turned around and appeared to be going the right way which I was relived about because at this time we had already been sitting on the side of a road for 40 minutes. This is 3 girls at the age of 16 who have relied on YOUR service to get home safely. The car is then driving back up the road towards us, and when it gets back to being 9 minutes away it turns onto a street again, going to completely wrong way. I call the driver again and he declines my call. The app then says that we have been picked up, which we had NOT. The ride then says it’s over, but we were still sitting on the side of the road! We then tried ONE more time, by this point we had been there for about an hour, and after 10 minutes of the app trying to find us a car we gave up. We then ordered an uber, it came in three minutes and pulled over safely onto a side street and got us to exactly where we wanted to go quickly, comfortable and safely.

The app shows shorter waiting time and when you request the ride the waiting period increase.  Also when you waiting for the ride all a sudden your waiting period increase results in all sort of inconveniences if you running late. Really bad experience overall.  I rather pay extra and use other services than ola.

                Ola sucks at the moment with the fact that when you request a ride, drivers are around 10 minutes away. And sometimes once your ride gets accepted, your driver then decides to cancel on you which is pretty frustrating. With Uber requesting a ride usually brings in a driver that is just a few minutes away.

                It's the worst cab service you can ever experience. OLA mobile app itself has lots of bugs (trust me very serious bugs!)We did a booking last week from the sydney airport pickup location. App showed ETA as 3 mins. Within the next minute driver called and said it will take 10 mins for him to arrive (but the app still shows 3 mins). Then less than a minute time got an alert saying driver cancelled the trip. Same time there was a deduction from my bank card to the full estimated fare of AUD 35. Ola app deducted money from my card for a never showed up taxi for the full estimated fare!I tried searching for a OLA support contact number and there's no number as such listed on their web site. There's a support email ID which they only replied to me once saying there was a OLA system technical issue but never got back to me after that. I'm asking an update daily basis (I want my money back!) but no update as yet.Please don't don't use OLA app giving your credit card details.They have a coupon system which is also buggy which you will end up paying more.

                I usually do not write bad reviews since I think businesses sometimes cannot fulfil customer expectations and thats ok. But I have to make a complaint about Olacab service since they dont have a  complaint facility in their support section.The worst cab service I have ever encountered.No accountability from drivers at all. They cancel the ride after accepting it since they know we cannot give feedback.It is frustrating and unprofessional behaviour.Other services like Uber are little more expensive but I never had such a bad experience with them.

                Absolutely terrible customer service. I have had a number of issues and each time I contact support, they mark it as resolved, without actually resolving anything. Also be aware the referral bonus they offer you expires within a week and they do not even warn you about this. Other problems experience include driver getting lost and charging extra and on a seperate occasion the driver stopping suddenly/taking off quickly. Only good thing is it is cheaper than Uber.

","
                I have had a terrible first experience with OLA. Yet I am giving a 3 star review in acknowledgement of their efforts.Like few others in the reviews. I booked an OLA for the first time only to be cancelled by the driver. Funnily, instead of just being cancelled by the driver, the driver called me and asked me to cancel. When I tried to talk with him as to why, he simply mocked me and hung up the phone saying that i would be charged a fee if i don't cancel soon and he would be getting free money.The silver lining came from when I sent OLA cabs an email detailing this story to inform them of this driver's conduct. OLA called me almost instantly to talk with me on what happened and to assure me that this wasn't what the company represented nor would they let this slide.the experience overall was worth less than a star from the driver but the company showed genuine concern when they called me almost instantly in response to my email. This is why I may consider giving OLA another go and the reason for me leaving a neutral rating and not a negative one.The driver may have been offensive but it is not the company's fault and shouldn't reflect badly on them after they show such commitment to their users.

                I’ve been a regular ride share user for the last 5 years and would generally take an Uber around 4-5 times a week.  In the last few months I switched over to Ola thinking I could save some $$$  Worse decision ever!!  I did not proceed with a ride one night as phone ran out of battery and couldn’t locate driver.  When got home later that night saw I had been deducted over $120 in fare.  When opened the map the ola driver had kept app on for over two hours and drove all around Melbourne making about 10 different stops.  It seems obvious that he had not canceled my booking but instead kept it open while he used another ride share app to pick up and drop off passengers to double up in fees.   I complained to ola and after three weeks got a response back saying the driver said i had  taken the booked ride and they wouldnt refund the fees.   I have proof I was not in the car at that time including receipt I was at ATM on opposite side of town from where car was.  Anyone would see if looked at map that no one would take a ride in that way.    Uber would have resolved this immediately. Now what ever saving I thought I was making with Ola is non-existent.  Definitely won’t make same mistake again!!
